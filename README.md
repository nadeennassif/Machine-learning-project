# Machine-learning-project
RSNA has teamed with the American Society of Neuroradiology (ASNR) and the American Society of Spine Radiology (ASSR) to conduct an AI challenge competition exploring whether artificial intelligence can be used to aid in the detection and localization of cervical spine fractures.

To create the ground truth dataset, the challenge planning task force collected imaging data sourced from twelve sites on six continents, including approximately 3,000 CT studies. Spine radiology specialists from the ASNR and ASSR provided expert image level annotations these studies to indicate the presence, vertebral level and location of any cervical spine fractures.

In this challenge competition, you will try to develop machine learning models that match the radiologists' performance in detecting and localizing fractures to the seven vertebrae that comprise the cervical spine. Winners will be recognized at an event during the RSNA 2022 annual meeting.
